Lesson 1: 
#############################

Set up student.py file as follows

            from datetime import date, timedelta

            class Student:
                """ A Student class as a basee for method testing """
                def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
                    self._first_name  = first_name
                    self._last_name = last_name
                    self._start_date = date.today()
                    # this date doesn't include leap years, as an fyi
                    self.end_date = date.today() + timedelta(days=365)
                    self.naughty_list = False

                @property
                def full_name(self):
                    return f"{self._first_name} {self._last_name}"


#############################
LESSON 2:
#############################

First thing to do is set up test_student.py as so:
    
            import unittest
            from student import Student


            class TestStudent(unittest.TestCase):
                def test_full_name(self):
                    student = Student("John", "Doe")
                    self.assertEqual(student.full_name, "John Doe")


            if __name__ == "__main__":
                unittest.main()

This tests if full name is being returned

#############################
LESSON 3
#############################

Add test for alert santa

            def test_alert_santa(self):
                # Create instance
                student = Student("John",  "Doe")
                # Call the function
                student.alert_santa()
                # Check it changed
                self.assertTrue(student.naughty_list)


#############################
LESSON 4
#############################

Add code for alert santa

            
            def alert_santa(self):
                self.naughty_list = True

Add test and code for returning student email

            def test_email(self):
                student = Student("John", "Doe")
                self.assertEqual(student.email, "john.doe@email.com")


            @property
            def email(self):
                return f'{self._first_name.lower()}.{self._last_name.lower()}@email.com'


#############################
LESSON 5 - refactor with DRY
#############################

NOTES
here we're going to use UnitTest methods - setUp and TearDown
These are defined using camel case

* add setUp to test each student
* add print statements to each test so you see when they happen


The TearDown method:
    Removes temporary files etc
    It is not needed in this project, but is included to see when it is run behind the scenes


#############################
LESSON 6 - the extension challenge
#############################

INSTRUCTOR STEPS
    * Create new test method called test_apply_extension
    * Inside this, store the current end_date for our student instance in a variable called old_end_date
    * Call a method named apply_extension that will take a number of days as an arguement on thr student instance to update the end_date
    * Assert whether the instance's end_date equals the old end date plus the days arguement that was passed in using time delta
    * Run the tests to confirm that the new method is failing
    * In the student class, create a new method called apply_extension that has a parameter called days
    * USe the timedelta method from datetime to update the end_date property
    * Run the tests to confirm they are working
