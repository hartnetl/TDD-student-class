Lesson 1: 

Set up student.py file as follows

            from datetime import date, timedelta

            class Student:
                """ A Student class as a basee for method testing """
                def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
                    self._first_name  = first_name
                    self._last_name = last_name
                    self._start_date = date.today()
                    # this date doesn't include leap years, as an fyi
                    self.end_date = date.today() + timedelta(days=365)
                    self.naughty_list = False

                @property
                def full_name(self):
                    return f"{self._first_name} {self._last_name}"


LESSON 2:

First thing to do is set up test_student.py as so:
    
            import unittest
            from student import Student


            class TestStudent(unittest.TestCase):
                def test_full_name(self):
                    student = Student("John", "Doe")
                    self.assertEqual(student.full_name, "John Doe")


            if __name__ == "__main__":
                unittest.main()
